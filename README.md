pnpm check:fix           # Automatically fix issues
```

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The backend follows a **Feature-Based Architecture**.

Each feature owns its:

* Routes
* Controllers
* Services
* Schemas
* Types
* Database Queries
* Utilities
* Constants

This keeps business logic isolated and allows teams to scale features independently.

### Rule of Thumb

Before creating a file in a root-level directory, ask:

> Will this be used by multiple features?

If yes → place it in a shared/global directory.

If no → keep it inside the feature.

## 🔄 Request Flow

```txt

## 🔐 Authentication Strategy

Authentication is powered by Better Auth.

Features include:

* Email & Password Authentication
* Session Management
* Secure Cookie Handling
* OAuth Support
* Protected Routes
* Role-Based Access Control
* User Session Validation

Authentication-related logic should remain inside:

```txt
features/authentication/
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Strategy

All database operations must be performed through Prisma.

### Database Flow

```txt
Schema
   ↓
Migration
   ↓
Database
   ↓
Prisma Client
   ↓
Service Layer
```

### Rules

✅ Use Prisma Client

✅ Keep queries inside services

❌ Avoid database access inside controllers

❌ Avoid raw SQL unless absolutely necessary

---

## 📝 Validation Rules

All incoming requests must be validated.

Use Zod schemas for:

* Request Body
* Query Parameters
* Route Parameters

Example:

```ts
const createAssessmentSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
});
```

Controllers should never trust incoming data.

---

## 📐 Development Guidelines

### File Naming

Use **kebab-case** for all files and folders.

✅ Good

```txt
skill-analysis-service.ts
create-assessment-schema.ts
auth-controller.ts
```

❌ Bad

```txt
SkillAnalysisService.ts
CreateAssessmentSchema.ts
AuthController.ts
```

---

### Controller Naming

```txt
auth-controller.ts
user-controller.ts
assessment-controller.ts
```

---

### Service Naming

```txt
auth-service.ts
assessment-service.ts
recommendation-service.ts
```

---

### Schema Naming

```txt
login-schema.ts
create-assessment-schema.ts
update-profile-schema.ts
```

---

### Route Naming

```txt
auth-routes.ts
user-routes.ts
assessment-routes.ts
```

---

### Type Naming

```txt
user.types.ts
assessment.types.ts
recommendation.types.ts
```

---

### Import Order

```ts
// Node modules
import express from "express";

// Third-party packages
import { z } from "zod";

// Internal modules
import { authService } from "@/features/authentication/services/auth-service";

// Relative imports
import "./some-file";
```

---

### Controller Rules

Controllers should only:

* Receive requests
* Validate input
* Call services
* Return responses

Keep business logic out of controllers.

---

### Service Rules

Services should contain:

* Business logic
* Database interactions
* External integrations
* Domain-specific operations

---

### Error Handling Rules

Use centralized error handling.

✅ Good

```ts
throw new AppError("User not found", 404);
```

❌ Avoid

```ts
res.status(500).json({
  message: "Something went wrong",
});
```

inside services.

---

### TypeScript Rules

* Avoid `any`
* Prefer `unknown`
* Use strict typing
* Define reusable types
* Keep feature-specific types inside features

---

## 🛡️ Security Guidelines

* Never expose secrets in code
* Store configuration in environment variables
* Validate all incoming data
* Protect authenticated routes
* Sanitize user input
* Use secure cookies
* Follow least-privilege principles

---

## 🎯 Development Principles

* Type Safety First
* Feature-Based Architecture
* Service-Oriented Design
* Separation of Concerns
* Secure by Default
* Clean Code Practices
* Maintainability Over Cleverness
* Scalability Over Short-Term Convenience

---

## ✅ Pull Request Checklist

Before creating a PR:

```bash
pnpm check
pnpm build
```

Ensure:

* No TypeScript errors
* No linting issues
* Build succeeds
* Database migrations are included
* New code follows project conventions
* Feature-specific code remains inside its feature directory
